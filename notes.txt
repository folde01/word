# stories

user names shouldn't be the same

words should have no repeating letters

ui shouldn't show the requested page if we're in the wrong game state

if guess is correct ui should show winner and start a new game


# future stories

player1 goes to site, registers, logs in, sees player2 would like a game, asks for a game, and plays with player2. 

player should be able to challenge the existence of the guessed word... or the game just checks and rejects it. should you lose your turn if it's rejected? or should that be a preference?
