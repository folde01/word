# stories

state: Anything you do at the wrong time should give you gameState so you know what to do.


UI: / route should give you the UI where it asks for user 1, user 2, lets user 1 guess, then 2, then 1... until someone wins or exits.

# future stories

player1 goes to site, registers, logs in, sees player2 would like a game, asks for a game, and plays with player2. 

player should be able to challenge the existence of the guessed word... or the game just checks and rejects it. should you lose your turn if it's rejected? or should that be a preference?
